get_profile is always fast
get_timeline is always fast
get_timeline_pull can be slow
send_message can be slow


experiment 1
change number of erlang threads -> measure speedup of get_profile
experiment 2
getting timeline push based vs pull based implementation (vs centralized implementation)
measure difference in speed and difference in consistency
experiment 3
